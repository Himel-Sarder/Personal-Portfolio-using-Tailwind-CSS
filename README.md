## Project Vision

The portfolio website aims to create a dynamic digital platform where my skills and work are presented professionally. Using a sleek, dark-themed interface accented by a vibrant orange hue, the site highlights essential information about my background, services, and projects. Each element is thoughtfully animated to enhance the user experience, and a consistent visual style reinforces my brand identity.

## Key Features

### 1. **Interactive Header with Navigation**
   - **Logo and Navigation:** At the top, the header includes my logo, ‚ÄúHimelüê¶‚Äçüî•,‚Äù and navigation links. Each link has an animated underline effect, enhancing the interaction and making it easy for visitors to explore various sections such as Home, Services, Projects, About, and Contacts.
   - **Dynamic Background:** The dark background is paired with a subtle gradient and bubble animation, adding a modern touch without overwhelming the content.

### 2. **Hero Section**
   - **Introduction Text:** This section features a warm greeting and a brief introduction about me, ‚ÄúHi, I'm Himel Sarder - Creative Web Designer,‚Äù that sets the tone for the rest of the site.
   - **Animated Elements:** Text elements in this section fade in with a slight delay, adding elegance and professionalism to the first impression.
   - **Call-to-Action Buttons:** There are two primary buttons‚Äî‚ÄúHire Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúContact Me.‚Äù These guide visitors to specific actions, emphasizing my availability for projects or inquiries.

### 3. **Floating Image Section**
   - On the left side, there‚Äôs a rotated image (side.png) that acts as an eye-catching visual anchor. Positioned to float as visitors scroll, it reflects my creative personality and adds an unconventional design element.

### 4. **Social Media Integration**
   - **Icons with Hover Effects:** The website features icons for platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. Each icon is designed to transform slightly on hover, displaying a subtle color change and scale effect, encouraging visitors to connect on multiple channels.
